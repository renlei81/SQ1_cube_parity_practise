# SQ1_cube_parity_practise
This is a simple tool to help SQ1 players practise the CSP parity reading. The tool is still quite preliminary and needs further refinement. This is inspired by the parity training tool from Squanmate, a web for CSP learning. I have implemented functionality in the tool to record execution time and measure accuracy. A simple UI is also included in this software. You can check the latest result TSV in "D:\CSP_parity". An exe was also provided. You can modify the save_dir to change where it is saved.
